# Introduction to Python
This repository stores the notebooks for a very brief (10 minute) introduction to Python. Many
key features are not covered as the introduction is very short. For a much more detailed and 
complete introduction see for example the Python documentation
https://www.python.org/doc/ and the documentation of the packages I use like [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) 
and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

There is also some simulated data to experiment with, generated using [numpy.random](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html?highlight=random#module-numpy.random)
